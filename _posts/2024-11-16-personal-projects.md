In my free time, I refuse to stay idle. Whether it's pushing my limits in sports, diving into AI projects, or making progress on my book, there's always something in the works.

## Changing gym social networking for the best...

**Figure this out**: when you meet cool people in the gym, you don't always add them on Instagram. And it's fun when they're there when you train. But most of the time, they are not.
Because your schedules aren't matching.

Sad, uh ? Well. What if...

**Now, take that...** 
You've motivated yourself to start working out. You got your new gym membership.
First day in the gym, you see those big men squatting 150 kg like if they are taking a nap or something. 
You're like : "am I supposed to do this?".

Well, how can you know? Mhhh. Well. What if...

**And that...**
You've got some years in the gym now. You're good, but you wanna be *great*. You want someone to tell you 
> "Bro, your squat is good but I noticed you knees can stretch in a better way. See that angle? This is your knee amplitude. Mhh, mmhh. From the third rep, form isn't good anymore." Blablabla.

Fun fact : you're **broke**. In fact, who can afford a professional and personalized coaching ? 

Okay. This is where **we come in** :
