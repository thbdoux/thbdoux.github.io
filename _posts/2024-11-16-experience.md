## HeadMind Partners AI

### Internship (April 2023 - October 2023)

During my internship at **HeadMind Partners AI & Blockchain**, I focused on innovative research and development projects in audio processing and deep learning:

- **R&D: Speech Emotion Recognition**: 
  - Fine-tuned **wav2vec2** and **HuBERT** encoders with a custom fully connected layer for **valence/arousal regression**, achieving **state-of-the-art (SOTA)** results on benchmark datasets such as **RAVDESS** and **IEMOCAP**. This work highlighted the potential of pre-trained audio models for emotion detection tasks with high accuracy and robustness.
- **R&D: Audio Generation and Conversion**:
  - Partially fine-tuned the **Tortoise model** (a combination of **ViT + GPT-2**, with a frozen diffusion model) to generate French speech. Despite efforts, results were somewhat underwhelming due to limited diversity in available French audio data, often biased towards Canadian accents.
  - Fine-tuned a **voice cloning model (RVC)** on multiple voices, including my manager's voice, to create highly realistic voice clones. This included a memorable moment where I pranked a colleague by using **real-time voice conversion** with his voice over the phone â€” with impressive results (shout out to him!).

### Full-Time Data Scientist Role (November 2023 - September 2024)

As a full-time data scientist, I took on a combination of client missions and continued R&D work, building on my previous experience and driving impactful AI solutions:

- **Client Mission: Supply Chain Optimization**:
  - Designed and deployed an optimization solver for a leading French luxury brand, using **Constraint Programming** and **Stochastic Optimization** techniques. The system reduced the average combinatorial cost of raw material distribution by 30% and was implemented using **AWS services** like S3, Lambda, and SageMaker, scaling to production effectively.
- **Client Mission: Deepfake Generation**:
  - Developed real-time **audio and video deepfakes** to raise awareness about potential digital risks among corporate executives.
- **R&D: Meeting Summarizer with LLM, Diarization, and Speech-to-Text (STT)**:
  - Built a meeting summarization pipeline integrating **automatic speech recognition (ASR)**, speaker diarization, and **large language models (LLMs)** to automatically transcribe and summarize meetings with high accuracy and relevance.
- **R&D: Vocal Assistant**:
  - Created a **vocal assistant API** that leveraged **LLMs (Mistral/GPTs)**, **WhisperX**, **Text-to-Speech models**, and frameworks like **LangChain** and **FastAPI/SocketIO** for seamless, real-time voice interaction and communication capabilities.
