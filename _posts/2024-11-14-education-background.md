## Step 1: Baccalauréat and CPGE (2017 - 2019)


I embarked on my academic path at Lycée Gustave Eiffel, Bordeaux, enrolling in the **Classes Préparatoires aux Grandes Écoles (CPGE)** with a specialization in **Mathematics, Physics, and Mechanics (PSI*)**. The highly selective and intense nature of CPGE shaped my analytical skills and provided a rigorous foundation for further studies.

## Step 2: ISAE-Supaero (2019 - 2021)

My entry into **ISAE-Supaero** marked a new chapter of engineering excellence. The first two years focused on broad engineering training, deepening my knowledge in applied mathematics, computer science, and physics. This versatile training prepared me for real-world problem-solving and further specialization.

## Step 3: Particle Physics Research at L2IT (2021)

My first major research experience came at the **Laboratoire des 2 Infinis de Toulouse (L2IT)**, where I worked on **Higgs boson pair-production** analysis within the **ATLAS experiment**. Using advanced modeling techniques like the **Matrix Element Method**, I quantified detector inaccuracies and gained practical skills in statistical analysis.


The framework of **Quantum Field Theory (QFT)** fascinated me:


$$\mathcal{L} = \frac{1}{2} \partial_\mu \phi \partial^\mu \phi - \frac{1}{2} m^2 \phi^2 - \frac{\lambda}{4!} \phi^4$$

Driven by a passion for theoretical physics, I joined **Ecole Polytechnique** for a master's in **High Energy Physics**. I explored **Quantum Field Theory, Particle Physics, and Astrophysics**, which sharpened my theoretical and research skills. An internship at the **Hyper-Kamiokande experiment** in Japan allowed me to develop photomultiplier readout electronics, enhancing my expertise in detector data analysis.

$$
R_{\mu \nu} - \frac{1}{2} g_{\mu \nu} R + \Lambda g_{\mu \nu} = \frac{8 \pi G}{c^4} T_{\mu \nu}
$$


*Einstein’s equation symbolizes my fascination with fundamental physics and mathematical precision.*

## Step 5: Data Science and Applied Mathematics Specialization at ISAE-Supaero (2022 - 2023)

Returning to **ISAE-Supaero**, I specialized in **Data Science and Applied Mathematics**, a transformative year marked by the rapid rise of **ChatGPT** and generative AI in the public sphere. My training was both theoretical and applied, covering:

- **Mathematics Behind Machine Learning**: Rigorous statistical methods, linear algebra, multivariate calculus, and probabilistic models formed the basis for developing ML algorithms.
- **Stochastic Optimization**: Explored optimization methods in uncertain and complex environments, particularly useful for real-world scenarios where data is noisy or incomplete.
- **High-Performance Computing (HPC)**: Leveraged parallel computing to enhance ML model efficiency. Learned **CUDA programming** for GPU-accelerated computations to optimize neural networks.
- **Deep Learning and Computer Vision**: Built and fine-tuned convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image classification and object detection tasks.
- **Transformers and NLP**: Delved into cutting-edge **transformer architectures** that power large language models, aligning closely with the advancements in conversational AI such as **ChatGPT**.
